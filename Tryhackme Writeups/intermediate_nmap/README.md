# Intermediate Nmap

Today we look at the new Tryhackme room Intermediate Nmap. This room labeled as easy room.

**Firstly** we must start machine.

![First](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tunahanucar/CTF-Writeups/main/Tryhackme%20Writeups/intermediate_nmap/img/first.png)

And we perform a **nmap** scan on this ip address. 

![Second](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tunahanucar/CTF-Writeups/main/Tryhackme%20Writeups/intermediate_nmap/img/second.png)

Let's see the results. There are 3 opened ports. 22, 2222 and 31337.

![Third](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tunahanucar/CTF-Writeups/main/Tryhackme%20Writeups/intermediate_nmap/img/third.png)

Connect the Elite port (31337) on web browser.
![Fourth](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tunahanucar/CTF-Writeups/main/Tryhackme%20Writeups/intermediate_nmap/img/fourth.png)

Yes!! We have login credentials now. Let's use 22nd port. We can now provide an ssh connection.

Now we can check where we are and what files we have. There are no files. But we have a second user named user.
![Sixth](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tunahanucar/CTF-Writeups/main/Tryhackme%20Writeups/intermediate_nmap/img/sixth.png)

See this. Flag is here. A really easy ctf ha?

I would like to thank the producers of the room.
